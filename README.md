# Introduction 

&nbsp; Hello and welcome to my personal github portfolio!! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Robert Denim Horton, those who know me call me Denim. Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the BS Computer Science program at UCCS (_University Colorado Colorado Springs_).  I am also curretnly employed as a _Software Engineer Intern_ at _GPS Source_, A susidary company of _General Dynamics: Mission Systems_.  I first developed my passion for computer a couple years after first returning back to college. <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; After over 9 years in the service industry I gained a wide varity of personal interrealtionship skills and was able to develop an intrest in technology during that time through different hobbies and friends, automation interested me the most.  Living in my hometown _Pueblo, Colorado_  CSU-Pueblo had an excellent Mechatronic Program where I took several classes and picked up basics engineering skills.  After a couple of years messing around with computers within my engineering classes I realized my true passion was in computers them selves. After those first two years I changed my major to an BS in Computer Science. <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;   Now I am currently on my last two semesters at UCCS where I plan to graduate and possibly go back for my master in the near the future.  During my time as a student and an intern I have developed many skills
